The Fundzone App is a single-page web application designed to help small businesses and freelancers manage their project finances efficiently. It provides a centralized platform for tracking income and expenses, managing invoices, and generating key financial reports, all in real-time.

Key Features

Transaction Ledger: A comprehensive table to record, edit, and delete all financial transactions. The ledger includes filtering and sorting capabilities for easy data management.

Invoicing System: Create and manage invoices for your clients. Track their payment status and easily mark them as "Paid".

Financial Reports: Generate essential financial reports, including a Profit & Loss (P&L) statement and a budget-tracking report that compares actual spending against set budgets.

Multi-Project Management: Easily switch between different projects to view and manage their specific financial data.

Data Persistence: All data is saved securely in a cloud-based database, ensuring your financial records are safe and accessible from anywhere.

Technologies Used
This application is built with modern web technologies to be fast, responsive, and easy to maintain.

Frontend:

React: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive design.

Backend:

Firebase/Firestore: A flexible, NoSQL cloud database that provides real-time data synchronization.

Installation & Setup
To run this application, you will need to host it on a web server or a service like GitHub Pages or Netlify.

Deploy: Upload the index.html file to your chosen web hosting service. The app is self-contained and will run immediately.
